# Assembly analysis

This repository is used to get more in touch with embedded software and assembly, because I enjoy working with it.<br>
It is just a few different programs in different compiled languages decompiled to assembly. I take a look at them to learn how 
the different compiler work.

## Further information

The code does not follow any usecase. I just set this repository to public to document my personal learn progress.
